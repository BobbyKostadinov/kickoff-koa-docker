## kickoff-koa-docker

The purpose of this package is to provide a basic, test-ready KOA project within seconds. For those that want to expermiment wiht Docker and / or AWS Elastic Beanstalk I've added the needed configuration and Docker file to run this as a Docker image

The Docker image creates an nginx server that forwards request to the node app

## Install

After cloning the repository run

    npm install

To start the koa server

    npm start

To run tests

    npm test

or to run tests alone withouth coverage:

    gulp test --harmony
